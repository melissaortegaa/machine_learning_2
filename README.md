## Dimensionality reduction

lab_dim_red: this contains Python code demonstrating the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and t-SNE using NumPy.

To execute the "dim_red.ipynb" code, follow these steps:

1. Download the photo folder from the shared link provided in the class.
2. Save the downloaded folder uncompressed inside the lab1_dim_red directory.

## Clustering

clustering.ipynb contains the implementation of k-means and k-medoids using numpy. Also compares the results with others algorithms such as DBSCAN and Spectral clustering from the scikit-learn library.

## Dependencies
The code requires the following dependencies:

* Python 3.11
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV (cv2)
